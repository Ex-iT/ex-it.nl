      A collection of my notes from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)"
        title="Capture the Flag"
        target="_blank">CTF</a
      >'s and other coding projects I've been doing over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I've been taking notes while doing CTF's, on mostly <a
        href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/169430"
        target="_blank">Hack The Box</a
      > and <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/p/MrBlonde" target="_blank"
        >TryHackMe</a
      >, I wanted to have a place to store and easily search (type <Badge
        variant="outline">/</Badge
      > to search) through them. These are definitely not tutorials or proper blog
      posts, just a collection of my personal notes.
